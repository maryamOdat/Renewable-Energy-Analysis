# Renewable Energy Analysis: 1985-2021  

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global renewable energy trends from 1985 to 2021. It examines the interplay between energy production, consumption, GDP, population, and other key factors. Using datasets from Kaggle and external sources, the project aims to address critical challenges in optimizing renewable energy capacity for sustainable economic growth.  

## Key Highlights  
- **Business Problem:** Identifying optimal renewable energy generation capacity to meet global energy needs while considering economic, demographic, and infrastructure variables.  
- **Data Insights:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals key trends, correlations, and regional disparities in renewable energy practices across wind, solar, hydro, and bioenergy sources.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Leveraging regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge), the project predicts renewable energy percentages by country with optimized metrics after feature normalization.  
- **Dashboard & Visualizations:** An interactive Tableau Public dashboard and detailed visualizations highlight energy trends, GDP, population, and renewable energy production across continents and countries.  
- **DataFolio:** A structured report presenting findings and analysis, offering insights into regional disparities, key renewable energy sources, and their economic and environmental impacts.  

## My Contributions  
I played an integral role throughout the project, contributing to all stages of the **analysis process**, from planning and **data collection** to performing **EDA** and deriving **conclusions**. Specifically, I:  
- Designed and wrote the **DataFolio**, a comprehensive report documenting the findings, analysis, and methodology.  
- Created the **dashboard** and **visualizations** to present data insights in an accessible and visually compelling manner.  
- Collaborated on model development and analysis to ensure meaningful and actionable results.  

## Impact  
This analysis offers actionable insights for policymakers, investors, and energy planners to make informed decisions about renewable energy adoption. By optimizing resource allocation and fostering economic and environmental sustainability, the project contributes to bridging the gap between energy production and consumption.
